# Strands Playground

This project is a playground for learning and experimenting with the AWS Strands agentic library.

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to explore the capabilities of Strands for building AI-powered applications. We will be creating a series of small command-line tools and other utilities to understand how to effectively use and debug Strands workflows.

## Getting Started

To get started, you will need to have Python installed. You can then install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Examples

The `src` directory contains the example applications. The first example, `hello_strands.py`, demonstrates a simple workflow that connects to an LLM API and responds to a user's prompt. You can run it like this:

```bash
python src/hello_strands.py --prompt "Hello! How are you today?"
```
